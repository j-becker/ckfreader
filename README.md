==============

This program helps with the validation of F(obs)/F(calc) data using the [PLATON](http://www.cryst.chem.uu.nl/spek/platon/pl000000.html) CheckCif validation output. The data for deviating I(obs), I(calc) data is extracted and then showed as table, allowing to sort the data and to generate OMIT instructions for [SHELXL](http://shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/SHELX/).

Requirements:
